The specifications said we did not have to use nose, and I don't really see how else you can test this without nose, so I am going to assume that you want something like this.

----Test #1 for Submit button----
run docker-compose up
go to localhost
hit submit. there should be an error that is tailored to there being a submit error. go back. enter real values and submit them. hit submit again. You should see the same error that your originally saw. Successfully tested a null case for submit.


#----Test #2 for Display button---
run docker-compose up
go to localhost
hit display. you should see an error tailored to there being a display error. Successfully tested a null case for display. Now go back to your localhost, and enter real values. Hit submit. then hit display. you should see the values that you submitted. Successfully tested non-null cases of display and submit.
